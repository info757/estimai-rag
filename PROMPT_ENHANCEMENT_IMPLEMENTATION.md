# Dawn Ridge Accuracy Improvement - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1-3 Complete ✅  
**Approach**: Prompt Engineering + RAG Context Enhancement  
**No Model Fine-Tuning Required**

---

## What We Built

### Phase 1: Ground Truth Extraction ✅
**Files Created**:
- `scripts/parse_ground_truth_spreadsheets.py`
- `golden_dataset/ground_truth/dawn_ridge_annotations.json`

**Results**:
- Parsed 4 Excel spreadsheets from human estimator
- Extracted 29 utility items (17 storm, 6 sanitary, 6 water)
- Extracted 13 erosion control/material items
- Extracted 10 earthwork volume entries
- **Total Ground Truth**: 52 items, 6,752 LF of utilities

### Phase 2: Construction Vocabulary Generation ✅
**Files Created**:
- `scripts/generate_construction_definitions.py`
- `golden_dataset/construction_knowledge_base.json`

**Results**:
- Generated 28 construction term definitions using GPT-4
- Added 7 visual cue descriptions
- Added 5 estimation formulas
- **Total**: 40 knowledge base entries ready for RAG ingestion

**Key Terms Defined**:
- Materials: DIP, HDPE, PVC, RCP, Concrete
- Structures: SSMH, CB, DI, MH, CO
- Fittings: FES, SSL, SS
- Specifications: NCDOT 840.02, 840.14, 840.53

### Phase 3: Baseline Comparison ✅
**Files Created**:
- `scripts/compare_baseline_to_ground_truth.py`
- `golden_dataset/BASELINE_ACCURACY_SUMMARY.md`

**Baseline Results** (Before Enhancements):
```
Detection Rate: 24.1% (7/29 utility items)
Linear Footage: 21.2% (1,430/6,752 LF)

By Discipline:
- Storm: 35.3% detection, 39.9% LF accuracy
- Sanitary: 16.7% detection, 13.9% LF accuracy  
- Water: 0% detection, 0% LF accuracy

Missing Categories:
- Laterals: 0/55 (0%) - COMPLETE MISS
- Structures: 0/69 (0%) - COMPLETE MISS
- Fittings: 0/14 (0%) - COMPLETE MISS
- Erosion Control: 0/13 (0%) - COMPLETE MISS
```

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. Vision prompts too narrow (only mainline pipes)
2. Missing material definitions in RAG
3. JSON parsing failures (40% of responses)
4. No category-specific detection logic

### Phase 4: Enhanced Vision Prompts ✅
**Files Modified**:
- `app/vision/pipes_vision_agent_v2.py`
- `app/vision/grading_vision_agent.py`

**PipesVisionAgent Enhancements**:

**Before** (narrow scope):
```
"Extract pipes with diameter, material, length, depth"
```

**After** (comprehensive):
```
1. MAINLINE PIPES: Storm, sanitary, water mains
2. LATERALS/SERVICE CONNECTIONS: Dashed lines, SS Service, Copper Service
   - Visual cues, branching patterns, typical lengths
3. STRUCTURES: Manholes, catch basins, drop inlets, cleanouts, hydrants
   - Labels (MH-1, CB-2, NCDOT specs), elevations
4. FITTINGS: FES, valves, tees, collars, tie-ins
5. DEPTH/ELEVATION DATA: Callouts, IE, Rim elevations
6. LEGEND/ABBREVIATIONS: Material decoding
```

**Added**:
- 6 explicit extraction categories (was 1)
- Visual cue descriptions for each type
- Common abbreviation examples
- Structured JSON with item_type field
- 4 concrete examples (mainline, lateral, structure, fitting)
- Mandated ```json``` code block formatting

**GradingVisionAgent Enhancements**:

**Before** (grading only):
```
"Look for contours, spot elevations, cut/fill areas"
```

**After** (comprehensive site work):
```
1. GRADING & EARTHWORK: Contours, elevations, cut/fill volumes
2. EROSION CONTROL: Silt fence, inlet protection, slope matting, seeding
   - Temporary and permanent measures
   - Quantities in LF, SY, EA, AC
3. SITE IMPROVEMENTS: Retaining walls, fencing
   - Heights, lengths, locations
```

**Added**:
- erosion_control[] array in JSON
- site_work[] array in JSON
- Specific item names and quantity units
- Examples for EC and site work items

## Expected Impact

### Conservative Projection
```
Overall Detection: 24% → 55% (+31 points)
Linear Footage: 21% → 65% (+44 points)

Laterals: 0% → 40% (22/55 detected)
Structures: 0% → 30% (21/69 detected)
Fittings: 0% → 20% (3/14 detected)
Erosion Control: 0% → 30% (4/13 detected)
```

### Optimistic Projection
```
Overall Detection: 24% → 75% (+51 points)
Linear Footage: 21% → 85% (+64 points)

Laterals: 0% → 60% (33/55 detected)
Structures: 0% → 50% (35/69 detected)
Fittings: 0% → 40% (6/14 detected)
Erosion Control: 0% → 60% (8/13 detected)
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Why Prompt Engineering vs. Fine-Tuning?
**Decision**: Pure prompt + RAG context approach

**Rationale**:
- GPT-4o Vision is already capable - just needs better instructions
- Prompt changes deploy instantly (no training time)
- Generalizes to any project (not overfit to Dawn Ridge)
- Zero infrastructure/cost for model training
- Can iterate and test in hours, not days

**Evidence**: Ground truth analysis showed Vision IS detecting items (12 pipes found) but:
- Not asking for laterals → 0 found
- Not asking for structures → 0 found
- Not asking for fittings → 0 found

**Solution**: Ask for them explicitly → expect significant improvement

### 2. Why Not Create Separate Agents?
**Decision**: Enhanced prompts in existing 2 agents

**Rationale**:
- Plan specified "prompt engineering + RAG context"
- Consolidation vs. fragmentation: Better to have comprehensive agents
- Reduces coordination complexity
- Matches how human estimators think (utilities = pipes + laterals + structures)

**Trade-off**: Longer prompts, but GPT-4o handles them well

### 3. How Will We Validate Improvement?
**Tools Already Built**:
1. `compare_baseline_to_ground_truth.py` - Re-run to measure new detection rate
2. RAGAS evaluation framework - Already integrated
3. Custom metrics - pipe_count_accuracy, material_accuracy, elevation_accuracy

**Next Steps**:
1. Run enhanced system on Dawn Ridge PDF
2. Compare to baseline (24% → ?)
3. Generate iteration report
4. If < 55%, identify remaining gaps and iterate

## What's Still Missing (Out of Scope for Phase 1-3)

### Not Implemented (Lower Priority):
1. **RAG Ingestion**: construction_knowledge_base.json generated but not yet loaded into Qdrant
   - Can be done in 5 minutes with existing scripts
   - Will improve material recognition

2. **JSON Parsing Robustness**: Still some "No JSON found" warnings
   - Now mandating ```json``` code blocks should help
   - Can add fallback extraction if needed

3. **Advanced Earthwork**: Complex cut/fill calculations
   - Current system does basic trench volumes
   - Spreadsheet shows sophisticated formulas
   - Requires separate calculation module

4. **Legend Auto-Integration**: Currently manual extraction
   - Have script to extract legends
   - Not automatically fed to Vision agents yet

### Deferred (Future Enhancements):
5. **Additional Researchers**: Lateral researcher, structure researcher
   - RAG validation for new categories
   - Can leverage existing researcher framework

6. **Testing on Other Projects**: Generalizability validation
   - Need 2-3 other sitework PDFs
   - Measure accuracy across projects

## How to Test the Improvements

### Option 1: Full Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Run enhanced system on Dawn Ridge PDF
python scripts/compare_baseline_to_ground_truth.py

# This will:
# 1. Run EstimAI-RAG with enhanced prompts (8-10 min)
# 2. Compare to ground truth
# 3. Generate accuracy report
# 4. Save results to golden_dataset/
```

### Option 2: Single Page Test (Quick Validation)
```python
# Test on page 6 (known to have utilities)
from app.vision.coordinator import VisionCoordinator
import asyncio

coordinator = VisionCoordinator()
result = asyncio.run(coordinator.analyze_page(
    pdf_path="uploads/Dawn Ridge Homes_HEPA_Combined_04-1-25.pdf",
    page_num=6,
    agents_to_deploy=["pipes", "grading"],
    dpi=300
))

print(result)
# Check if laterals/structures detected
```

### Option 3: Prompt-Only Test (No PDF)
```python
# Test prompt with sample image
from app.vision.pipes_vision_agent_v2 import PipesVisionAgent

agent = PipesVisionAgent()
print(agent.get_user_prompt())
# Review enhanced prompt structure
```
