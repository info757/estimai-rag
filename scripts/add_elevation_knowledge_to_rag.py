Reading profile elevations:

- Read vertical scale for invert elevation
- Note: Ground elevation shown as separate line above pipe

Minimum slopes by discipline:

Storm Drains:

- Steeper in mountainous terrain

Sanitary Sewers:

Slope = (IE_OUT - IE_IN) / Length

- IE OUT = 648.00 ft
- Length = 200 ft

3. **Excessive depth**: Too deep (cost issue)
   - Pipe at 20 ft depth when 6 ft would work

4. **Uphill flow**: Gravity pipe going upward
   - IE IN < IE OUT means water flows uphill (impossible for gravity)

5. **Datum mismatch**: Mixing elevation systems
   - Plan sheet shows NAVD 88, profile uses project datum

6. **Decimal errors**: Typos in elevation values
   - IE = 64.50 ft (should be 645.50 ft based on context)

Validation checks:
- Cover depth 1-15 ft range (typical)
- Invert elevations decrease downstream (gravity flow)
- All structures on same datum
- Rim > Invert (always)
- Slopes between 0.5% and 10% (typical)""",
