# Production Accuracy Plan for Dawn Ridge 25-Page PDF

## Current State Analysis

**Ground Truth (Human Estimator)**:
- **Utilities**: 34 distinct items across 3 disciplines (Storm, Sanitary, Water)
  - Storm: 19 items (pipes, structures, fittings) - 2,956 LF of pipe
  - Sanitary: 6 items (pipes, laterals, structures) - 1,801 LF of pipe  
  - Water: 5 items (pipes, laterals, structures) - 1,118 LF of pipe
- **Materials**: 16 erosion control/site items (fencing, retaining walls, matting, seeding)
- **Earthwork**: Complex volumes (60,523 CY cut, 54,747 CY fill, 10,794 CY topsoil stripping)

**Current System Output**:
- 5 pipes detected (~1,178 LF total)
- Missing ~80% of items and categories
- Missing: erosion control, retaining walls, fencing, detailed earthwork breakdown
- Missing: laterals (service connections), fittings, many structures

**Gap**: We're only catching mainline pipes. Missing laterals, fittings, structures, site work, and accurate earthwork calculations.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Vision Agent Scope** 
   - Current: Focused on mainline pipes only
   - Missing: Laterals (4" SS Service, Copper Service), fittings (FES, valves), vertical structures (manholes, catch basins, inlets)

### 2. **Material/Abbreviation Knowledge**
   - Spreadsheet reveals: "DIP", "HDPE", "Corrugated HDPE", "FES", "SS Service", "SSL Cleanout"
   - Current RAG may not have all abbreviations decoded

### 3. **Earthwork Methodology**
   - Spreadsheet shows sophisticated calculations: Cut vs. Fill, Compaction factors, Stripping, Sectional analysis
   - Current system: Basic trench volumes only

### 4. **Missing Categories**
   - Erosion control (silt fence, inlet protection, seeding)
   - Site work (retaining walls, fencing)
   - These require enhanced Vision prompts

---

## Strategic Approach

### Phase 1: Diagnostic & Knowledge Enrichment (Week 1)
**Goal**: Parse spreadsheets, identify all missing materials/abbreviations, enhance RAG with construction industry knowledge

1. **Parse Spreadsheets Programmatically**
   - Extract all unique materials: "DIP", "Corrugated HDPE", "FES", "SSL Cleanout", etc.
   - Extract all structure types: "SSMH", "NCDOT 840.02 Concrete Catch Basin", etc.
   - Build comprehensive vocabulary list (50-100 terms)

2. **Generate Definitions for RAG (ONE-TIME SETUP)**

**NOT runtime web scraping - this is a ONE-TIME knowledge base enhancement**

For each abbreviation found in spreadsheet, generate definition using GPT-4:
```python
# Example: Extract "DIP" from spreadsheet
abbreviation = "DIP"
prompt = f"What does {abbreviation} mean in construction/sitework context? Provide brief definition."
definition = gpt4(prompt)  # "Ductile Iron Pipe - strong, flexible water/sewer pipe"

# Add to RAG knowledge base
add_to_rag({
  "term": "DIP",
  "definition": definition,
  "category": "pipe_material"
})
```

**Alternative**: Use Tavily for definitions if GPT-4 hallucinations are a concern:
```python
definition = tavily_search(f"construction term {abbreviation} definition")
```

**Key Point**: This happens ONCE during setup, NOT during every takeoff

3. **Enhance RAG Knowledge Base**
   - Add 100+ material definitions to RAG
   - Add structure type specifications
   - Add lateral/service connection standards
   - Add fitting/appurtenance descriptions

4. **Create Ground Truth Comparison**
   - Build JSON file mapping spreadsheet items to expected PDF locations
   - Manual annotation: Review PDF, note which pages contain laterals, fittings, structures

### Phase 2: Prompt & Context Engineering (Week 2)
**Goal**: Use enhanced prompts + RAG context to capture ALL categories (NO new agents needed)

**Core Philosophy**: GPT-4o Vision is smart enough - we just need to ASK for the right things and PROVIDE the right context.

1. **Enhanced PipesVisionAgent Prompt** (Single prompt handles everything)

Add explicit instructions to existing prompt:
```
COMPREHENSIVE EXTRACTION - Extract ALL of the following:

1. MAINLINE PIPES: Storm, sanitary, water mains with diameter, material, length
2. LATERALS/SERVICES: Service connections from main to buildings
   - Look for: "4\" SS Service", "Copper Service to meter", "6\" Fire Lateral"
   - Often shown as dashed lines or smaller pipes branching off mains
3. STRUCTURES (Vertical): Count and identify all
   - Manholes: MH-1, MH-2, SSMH (Sanitary Sewer Manhole)
   - Catch Basins: CB-1, CB-2, NCDOT 840.02 Concrete Catch Basin
   - Drop Inlets: DI-1, DI-2, NCDOT 840.14 Drop Inlet
   - Cleanouts: CO, SSL Cleanout
   - Hydrants: Fire hydrant assemblies
4. FITTINGS/APPURTENANCES:
   - FES (Flared End Section)
   - Valves (gate valves, check valves)
   - Tees, reducers, bends
   - Antiseep collars
5. DEPTHS: For each item, look for depth callouts in format:
   - "0-6'" (0 to 6 feet deep)
   - "6-8'" (6 to 8 feet deep)
   - "Average Depth: 9.2 ft"
```

2. **Enhanced GradingVisionAgent Prompt**

Add erosion control and site work detection:
```
SITE WORK & EROSION CONTROL - Look for:

1. EROSION CONTROL:
   - Silt fence / Diversion ditch (shown as wavy lines on perimeter)
   - Construction entrance (gravel pad at site entrance)
   - Inlet protection symbols (circles around storm inlets)
   - Slope matting areas (hatched areas on slopes)
   - Seeding/grassing areas (usually noted in legend or notes)
2. SITE IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Retaining walls (thick lines with height callouts)
   - Fencing (chain link, privacy fence with LF measurements)
3. GRADING VOLUMES:
   - Cut/Fill areas (usually shaded or hatched differently)
   - Topsoil stripping depth notes
```

3. **RAG Context Engineering** (The Secret Weapon)

Instead of new agents, enhance RAG with:
- **Material decoder**: "DIP = Ductile Iron Pipe, HDPE = High-Density Polyethylene, FES = Flared End Section"
- **Structure specs**: "NCDOT 840.02 = 4ft diameter concrete catch basin with 2ft sump"
- **Estimating formulas**: "Service lateral = main to building connection, typically 4\" diameter, average 30 LF per house"
- **Visual cues**: "Laterals shown as dashed lines perpendicular to mains"

When Vision LLM sees "4\" SS Service" â†’ queries RAG â†’ gets context â†’ understands it's a lateral

### Phase 3: Calculation Engine Overhaul (Week 3)
**Goal**: Match human estimator's earthwork methodology

1. **Reverse-Engineer Calculations**
   - From spreadsheet: Cut Volume = 60,523 CY, Fill Volume = 54,747 CY
   - Formulas shown: "Cut Compacted", "Fill Compacted", "Export-Import", "Per 0.1 ft"
   - Build calculation modules matching these

2. **Implement Advanced Earthwork**
   - Cut/Fill analysis (not just trench volumes)
   - Compaction factors (Fill Compacted = Fill Ã— 1.15)
   - Topsoil stripping (shown as 10,794 CY at 0.667 ft depth)
   - Sectional analysis (asphalt, curb, sidewalk, greenspace)

3. **Structure Excavation**
   - Manholes, catch basins need box excavation (not trench)
   - Depth-based calculations from spreadsheet depth columns

### Phase 4: Validation Using Existing RAGAS + Custom Metrics
**Goal**: Use your built-in evaluation framework to measure prompt iteration improvements

**You Already Have Perfect Evaluation Infrastructure!**

1. **Convert Spreadsheet to Ground Truth Format**

Create ground truth JSON matching your existing format:
```python
{
  "expected_pipes": [
    {
      "discipline": "sanitary",
      "material": "DIP",  # From "8\" DIP" in spreadsheet
      "diameter_in": 8,
      "length_ft": 177.67,  # From "Total Measure" column
      "depth_ft": 9.2,  # From "Average Depth" column
      # ... more fields
    },
    # ... 34 total items from Utilities spreadsheet
  ],
  "expected_retrieval_keywords": [
    "DIP", "Ductile Iron Pipe", "HDPE", "FES", "Flared End Section", "SSMH"
  ],
  "expected_summary": "34 utility items: 19 storm, 6 sanitary, 5 water..."
}
```

2. **Run Iterative Evaluation Loop**
```python
# Baseline (current prompts)
baseline_result = run_takeoff("Dawn Ridge.pdf")
baseline_scores = evaluate_both(baseline_result, ground_truth)

# Iteration 1: Add laterals to prompt
# ... update prompt ...
iter1_result = run_takeoff("Dawn Ridge.pdf")
iter1_scores = evaluate_both(iter1_result, ground_truth)

# Compare improvements
compare_results_table(baseline_scores, iter1_scores)
```

3. **Track These Metrics Per Iteration**

**Custom Metrics** (Domain Accuracy):
- `pipe_count_accuracy`: 5/34 detected â†’ 20/34 detected â†’ 30/34 detected
- `material_accuracy`: 60% â†’ 80% â†’ 90%
- `elevation_accuracy`: 100% (already good)

**RAGAS Metrics** (RAG Effectiveness):
- `faithfulness`: Is Vision citing RAG correctly for unknown materials?
- `context_recall`: Are we retrieving DIP, HDPE, FES definitions?
- `answer_relevancy`: Are results focused on utilities (not noise)?

4. **Automated Reporting After Each Iteration**

Your existing `format_custom_results_table()` and `compare_results_table()` already generate markdown reports!

### Phase 5: Generalization & Testing (Week 5)
**Goal**: Ensure system works on OTHER projects, not just Dawn Ridge

1. **Test on Different PDFs**
   - Run on 3-5 other sitework projects
   - Measure accuracy improvement across projects

2. **Make Knowledge Transferable**
   - Don't hardcode Dawn Ridge specifics
   - Ensure abbreviation decoder works for any project
   - Auto-extract project-specific legends (already built)

## How to Use Spreadsheet Data (CORE STRATEGY)

**The Spreadsheet is Our Diagnostic Tool, Not Training Data**

### The Iterative Improvement Loop:

```
1. Parse spreadsheet â†’ Extract what human found (ground truth)
2. Run current system â†’ Get AI output
3. Compare â†’ Identify gaps (what we missed)
4. Analyze WHY we missed it:
   - Prompt didn't ask for it? â†’ Update prompt
   - Material abbreviation unknown? â†’ Add to RAG
   - Visual pattern not described? â†’ Add visual cues to RAG
5. Re-run â†’ Measure improvement
6. Repeat until 85%+ accuracy
```

### Three Uses of Spreadsheet:

**Use #1: Vocabulary Extraction (for RAG)**
- Parse all materials/abbreviations from spreadsheet
- Generate definitions (using GPT-4 if needed, not web scraping)
- Add to RAG so Vision LLM has context when it encounters them

**Use #2: Prompt Gap Analysis**
- Spreadsheet shows 26 "4\" SS Service" laterals
- Current output: 0 laterals detected
- **Action**: Add "LATERALS" section to Vision prompt with examples

**Use #3: Accuracy Measurement**
- After each prompt iteration, compare output to spreadsheet
- Quantify: recall (% items found), precision (% items correct), quantity accuracy
- Track improvement over iterations

### Grading/Earthwork Strategy

**Challenge**: Spreadsheet shows final volumes (60,523 CY cut) but NOT the input data (elevation grids)

**Solution**:
1. Focus on INPUT extraction first: Get ALL spot elevations, contours, grid points from PDF
2. Don't try to replicate estimator's software - just capture raw elevation data
3. Simple validation: If we extract N elevation points, human can verify completeness
4. Advanced: Build grid-based cut/fill calculator (like estimator's software)

**Phase 2 Complete**: Detect 30+ of 34 utility items (88% recall)

**Phase 3 Complete**: Earthwork calculations within 10% of ground truth

**Phase 4 Complete**: Estimator validates output in <30 minutes (vs. 3-5 days manual)

**Production Ready**: 90%+ item detection, 85%+ quantity accuracy, <1 hour processing time

## Files to Create

1. `scripts/parse_ground_truth_spreadsheets.py` - Extract all items into JSON
2. `scripts/generate_construction_definitions.py` - Generate abbreviation definitions
3. `scripts/enhance_rag_from_ground_truth.py` - Add to knowledge base
4. `scripts/compare_output_to_ground_truth.py` - Accuracy measurement
5. Enhanced prompts in existing Vision agents (no new agent files needed)
6. `app/calculations/advanced_earthwork.py` - Cut/Fill analysis
7. `golden_dataset/ground_truth/dawn_ridge_annotations.json` - Ground truth from spreadsheets

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1**: PDF pages don't clearly show laterals/fittings
- **Mitigation**: Manual review of PDF first, annotate 5-10 examples, use as prompt training

**Risk 2**: Definition generation too slow/unreliable
- **Mitigation**: Use cached construction dictionary, GPT-4 to generate definitions (one-time setup)

**Risk 3**: Earthwork calculation methodology unknown
- **Mitigation**: Focus on input extraction, partner with estimator to explain calculations

**Risk 4**: Over-optimization for Dawn Ridge
- **Mitigation**: Test on 2-3 other projects in parallel, ensure generalizability
